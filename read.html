                In today’s times, we hear a lot about child abuse and molestation. It’s high time we start teaching  children about “Good Touch Bad Touch”
        All of us want children to be safe and secure and want to give them the best. We want to protect them against all odds. Children come in contact with many people every day and we cannot always be there to control certain situations they may be put in.
        So, it becomes our responsibility to sensitize them, equip them so that they are ready to face and handle any odd situation or person coming their way.
        Sensitizing children about various issues relating to good touch bad touch, make them emotionally strong and helps them to grow normally. It helps them handle “not so positive events” in life in a better way so that they do not impact their growth and personality.
        Come, let’s join hands to make this world a better and safer place for our young generation by fully exhausting and utilizing the route of dialogue. If your child is making up stories, you still need to listen to them - it is vital that as a parent, you support them, and believe them. They need to know they can trust you, and that you will protect them.
